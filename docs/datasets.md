# Datasets

## HD-VG-130M

[HD-VG-130M](https://github.com/daooshee/HD-VG-130M?tab=readme-ov-file) comprises 130M text-video pairs. The caption is generated by BLIP-2. We find the cut and the text quality are relatively poor. It contains 20 splits. For OpenSora 1.0, we use the first split (~350K). We plan to use the whole dataset and re-process it.

You can download the dataset and prepare it for training according to [the dataset repository's instructions](https://github.com/daooshee/HD-VG-130M). There is a README.md file in the Google Drive link that provides instructions on how to download and cut the videos. For this version, we directly use the dataset provided by the authors.

## Inter4k
